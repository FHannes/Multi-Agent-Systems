Chosen topics:

- Hybrid architectures
- Gradient field
- Social laws

Possible problems:

- Do problematic situations (e.g. deadlocks) occur when using a gradient field?
- When a package has been waiting for a long time, will adjusting field intensity help? Maybe also relevant for resolving deadlocks. (-> social laws)
- When many packages are clustered in the same area, will it help if they collectively emit a more attractive force?
- Is it interesting to have an agent emit a more repulsive force when approaching a package?
- When an agent has picked up a package, how does less repulsion influence other agents?
- When an agent is carrying a package, does it positively influence delivery time if it repulses more?
