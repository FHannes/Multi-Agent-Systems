I. An AGV (with parcel) wants to navigate to a point occupied by an AGV
    -> send message: "move-aside;requester=requester-name;parcel-wait-time=millis;want-pos=x,y;step=00" with requester-name equal to its own name
    -> wait until point is no longer occupied (so drive towards it) or other message hijacks priority
II. The AGV (with parcel) that triggered traffic jam coordination sees no occupied points along its route: send "home-free;requester=requester-name"
III. The AGV (with parcel) that triggered traffic jam coordination is once again stuck
    -> send new move-aside message with updated parcel-wait-time, want-pos and step
IV. An AGV (not currently involved in traffic jam) receives a move-aside message
    -> if want-pos does not equal either own position or next point in the path queue, ignore
    -> compares parcel-wait-time with own waiting time
        -> if equal: names of agents break the tie (agents have a number, smallest number wins; if own number smaller, then send own move-aside, otherwise activate "get out of the way" mode)
        -> if greater: send own move-aside (see point I.)
        -> if smaller: activate "get out of the way" mode, set step to initially received step (see message sent in I.)
V. An AGV is in "get out of the way" mode
    -> randomly pick unoccupied point
        -> if none available: randomly pick occupied point (not equal to the wants-pos of the message that triggered "get out of the way" mode)
        and send message: "move-aside;requester=requester-name;parcel-wait-time=millis;want-pos=x1,y1;step=00" (requester-name and parcel-wait-time are the same
        as received in I., albeit with passage of time accounted for with respect to parcel-wait-time, while wants-pos is equal to the randomly selected point),
        then wait until a point becomes unoccupied
        -> otherwise: move to the point and wait until confirmation that requester is home free
    -> if move-aside message received:
        -> if "want-pos" is not equal to point currently occupied or next point in the path queue, ignore
        -> if requester is equal to the one who triggered "get out of the way" mode:
            -> if step number is less than or equal to the current step number, then ignore, otherwise get out of the way once more (see "randomly pick unoccupied point)
        -> if requester is not equal and parcel-wait-time is larger than the current parcel-wait-time: message that triggered "get out of the way" mode is now the newly received message
    -> if home-free message received:
        -> if requester is not equal: ignore
        -> otherwise: resume normal operation
VI. An AGV is in "traverse gradient field" mode and receives move-aside message
    -> if AGV can make a move: ignore
    -> otherwise: randomly select occupied point and propagate move-aside message (store message that triggered propagation)
    -> if receives move-aside in the future
        -> if requester is equal:
            -> if steps is equal: propagate message
            -> otherwise: ignore
